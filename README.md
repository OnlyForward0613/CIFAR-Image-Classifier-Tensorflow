## Overview
Welcome to the Everyday Objects Classifier project! This repository addresses the challenge of classifying 10 different everyday objects using TensorFlow's CIFAR Image Dataset 🧭🔍. With 60,000 colorful images and 6000 images per class, we embark on a thrilling machine learning journey to achieve accurate object recognition! 🚀🔮

## Dataset
The CIFAR Image Dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images, categorized into 10 classes. Each class represents an everyday object, and the dataset is evenly distributed, with 6000 images per class. Below is a table summarizing the dataset information:

|   Class     | Number of Images|
|:-----------:|:---------------:|
|   ✈️Plane   |      6000       |
|   🚗Car     |      6000       |
|   🐤Bird    |      6000       |
|   🐈‍⬛Cat     |      6000       |
|   🦌Deer    |      6000       |
|   🐩Dog     |      6000       |
|   🐸Frog    |      6000       |
|  🏇🏾Horse    |      6000       |
|   🚢Ship    |      6000       |
|  🚛Truck    |      6000       |
